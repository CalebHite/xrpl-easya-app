## 🔗 How TrustLend Interacts with the XRP Ledger

- **Wallet Creation:**
  - When you log in or create an account, TrustLend generates a new XRPL testnet wallet in your browser (using xrpl.js) and funds it via the XRPL testnet faucet.
  - Wallets are stored locally in your browser for privacy and security.

- **Loan Transactions:**
  - When you request a loan, the app creates and submits a payment transaction on the XRPL testnet from the lender to the borrower.
  - All transactions are signed client-side and sent directly to the XRPL testnet via WebSocket.
  - Demo loans are automatically repaid after a short period by submitting a repayment transaction.

- **Credit Score Updates:**
  - After each successful repayment, your credit score is updated locally and reflected in your wallet's metadata.
  - Higher credit scores unlock higher loan tiers.

- **Transparency:**
  - All loan and repayment transactions are visible on the XRP Ledger testnet and can be viewed using a block explorer at [XRPL Testnet Explorer](https://testnet.xrpl.org/).
